

I want to build a multi-page website for my Hijab brand called ZCreation using React with Vite. It should be a modern, attractive website with smooth navigation and clear sections. 
Here are my updated requirements:

---

ðŸ“„ Pages (Total: 4) 

1. Home Page 

   * Introduction to ZCreation 
   * Brief overview of what we do
   * Visually attractive layout with soft colors and elegant fonts

2. About Us Page 

   * A detailed description of the brandâ€™s story, mission, and values
   * Mention focus on modest fashion and high-quality hijabs
   * Add a banner or image background

3. Products Page 

   * Read product data from a **local JSON file** (e.g., `products.json`)
   * Each product should display:

     * Product name
     * Image
     * Short description
     * Link to open the full product detail in a new tab or modal
   * Layout should be responsive, in card or grid form

4. Contact Us Page 

   * A form with:

     * Name
     * Email
     * Message
   * (Optional) Add basic form validation
   * Display submitted messages below the form or in a modal

ðŸ”— JSON Product Data 

* Store product info in a file like `products.json`
* Example data:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Elegant Black Hijab",
    "image": "/images/black.jpg",
    "description": "A timeless black hijab made of soft chiffon.",
    "link": "https://example.com/products/black-hijab"
  },
  ...
]
```

* React should dynamically load and map over this data in the **Products** page

---

ðŸŽ¨ Design & Styling 

* Use modern fonts like **Playfair Display**, **Inter**, or **Poppins**
* Use soft color palettes (e.g., beige, rose, white, gold tones)
* Include hover effects, button animations, and responsive design
* Consider using a UI library like **Tailwind CSS** or **styled-components** (optional)

---

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies 

* Use **React + Vite** (not Python or Flask)
* Use **React Router** for navigation between pages
* Load JSON data in **Products** page
* Host and develop the project on **Replit**

 

 âœ… Optional Add-ons (If time allows) 

* Add a sticky navigation bar or hamburger menu
* Add a footer with contact info and social links
* Use a modal or route-based product detail view
* Add favicon and responsive meta tags
